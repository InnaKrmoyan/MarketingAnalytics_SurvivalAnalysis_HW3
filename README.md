Survival Analysis and CLV Homework
Introduction
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of Survival Analysis and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) on a telecommunications dataset. The tasks involve building parametric models, comparing them, visualizing survival curves, calculating CLV, and exploring CLV within different customer segments.

Dataset
The dataset comprises subscriber information with features such as ID, region, tenure, age, marital status, income, education level, retirement status, gender, voice service, internet service, call forwarding, customer category, and churn indicator.

Tasks
Parametric Models
Build ATF Models: Create Accelerated Time-to-Event (AFT) models with various distributions.
Model Comparison: Compare the performance of different models.
Curve Visualization: Visualize survival curves in a single plot.
Decision Making: Choose the final model based on various factors.
CLV
Calculate CLV: Implement CLV calculation based on the chosen model.
Segment Exploration: Explore CLV within different customer segments.
Report
Findings
In our analysis, we interpreted coefficients from the chosen model, identified valuable customer segments, estimated an annual retention budget based on CLV and survival probabilities, and detected the number of at-risk subscribers within a year. Personalized retention strategies for these segments were recommended.
